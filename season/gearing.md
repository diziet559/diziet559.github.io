Although possible, there are no R12 and R13 Preraid sets listed here. With that dedication to ranking, some raiding for off-pieces should be considered as well.

Some random notes:

- Don't take Band of Accuria or Quick Strike Ring from melees, they aren't worth it for hunters and get replaced quickly
- Bloodseeker to Rhok'delar is only a 6 dps upgrade due to the weapon speed difference
- Devilsaur set to T1 hands+pants is a 5 dps upgrade
- Barbarous Blade to Lok'delar is a 2 dps upgrade
- Lok'delar to Huntsman's Harpoon is a 5 dps upgrade
- Beastmaster's Boots (D2 set) are the best non-hit boots available in P1
