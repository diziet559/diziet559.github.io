## Hunter notes for Season of Mastery

### Pet progression

Best pet for solo stuff, instances and raids is any type of (flying) bird for https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24579/screech. This is great for solo play due to its high threat generation and AP reduction to enemies, which reduces incoming damage to the tank (or your pet in solo play). The natural choices for pets thus are an owl for alliance that can be tamed in Teldrassil, or a bat for horde that can be found in Tirisfal Glades.

To get and upgrade your https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24579/screech ability, new pets must be tamed from time to time:

| Screech rank                                    | Beast to tame                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24423/screech | https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=154                          |
| https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24577/screech | https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4158                         |
| https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24578/screech | https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7097                         |
| https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24579/screech | https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8602, https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7456 |

For ranks 2 and 3 there are also other choices, but those listed here are the first available. For more information on pets in general, see [Petopia Classic](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/).

### Gear progression

With Dire Maul available on release, hunters in Season of Mastery have plenty of gearing options.

#### Biggest upgrades in phase 1

Obviously, https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers is the one item most hunters will want out of Molten Core. Keep in mind though that with https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19107/bloodseeker we have a very solid pre-raid weapon available that is only 5-10 dps behind Rhok'delar due to the difference in weapon speed.

If you do not aim for tier set completion, https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18812/wristguards-of-true-flight are a big upgrade over other options available for the wrist slot.

The single biggest upgrade in phase 1 will be the https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant received from turning in https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18423/head-of-onyxia. As your raid should be getting one of these every 5 days, you should be getting this item in due time.

The tier 1 set is also a very solid option for gearing, especially the 8-piece set bonus is a large dps boost. Keep in mind that with Season of Mastery's faster phase progression your raid will be hard pressed to give the full set to many hunters. The same goes for the two pieces of the tier 2 set that are available in phase 1 - get your hands on them if you can, but don't count on completing the set before it becomes obsolete.

In any case, do not take https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17063/band-of-accuria or https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18821/quick-strike-ring away from your melee players. While these two rings are technically the best rings for hunters in phase 1, they get quickly replaced and should be better left for those who will use them for longer.

This also holds for one-handed melee weapons like https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18832/brutality-blade and https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18805/core-hound-tooth as rogues and fury warriors can gain more from using them. You should also be melee weaving in any case, for which you need a two-handed weapon.
