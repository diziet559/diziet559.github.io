## Hunter notes for Season of Mastery

### Pet progression

Best pet for solo stuff, instances and raids is any type of (flying) bird for https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24579/screech. This is great for solo play due to its high threat generation and AP reduction to enemies, which reduces incoming damage to the tank (or your pet in solo play). The natural choices for pets thus are an owl for alliance that can be tamed in Teldrassil, or a bat for horde that can be found in Tirisfal Glades.

To get and upgrade your https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24579/screech ability, new pets must be tamed from time to time:

| Screech rank                                    | Beast to tame                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
